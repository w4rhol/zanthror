  xvar,

  male_code = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{measure}{Numeric vector of anthropometric measurements (e.g., height, weight, BMI)}

\item{xvar}{Numeric vector of the x-variable (usually age, but can be length/height for
weight-for-length/height charts). Units specified by ageunit parameter.}

\item{chart}{Character string specifying the growth chart code. Valid options:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Length/Height charts:} "la" (length-for-age), "ha" (height-for-age)
\item \strong{Weight charts:} "wa" (weight-for-age), "wl" (weight-for-length),
"wh" (weight-for-height)
\item \strong{BMI charts:} "ba" (BMI-for-age)
\item \strong{Head circumference:} "hca" (head circumference-for-age)
\item \strong{UK-specific charts:} "sha" (sitting height-for-age), "lla" (leg length-for-age),
"wsa" (waist-for-age), "bfa" (body fat-for-age)
\item \strong{WHO skinfolds:} "aca" (arm circumference-for-age), "ssa" (subscapular skinfold-for-age),
"tsa" (triceps skinfold-for-age)
}}

\item{version}{Character string specifying the reference population. Valid options:
\itemize{
\item "US" - 2000 CDC Growth Reference
\item "UK" - British 1990 Growth Reference
\item "WHO" - WHO Child Growth Standards (0-5y) + WHO Reference 2007 (5-19y)
\item "UKWHOpreterm" - UK-WHO composite for preterm births
\item "UKWHOterm" - UK-WHO composite for term births (37-42 weeks gestation)
}}

\item{gender}{Vector (string or numeric) indicating gender for each observation}

\item{male_code}{The code used for males in the gender variable (e.g., "M", "Male", 1, "m")}

\item{female_code}{The code used for females in the gender variable (e.g., "F", "Female", 2, "f")}

\item{gencode}{Character string specifying gender codes in format "male=M female=F" or
"female=F male=M" (deprecated - use male_code and female_code instead). Can use any codes
(e.g., "male=1 female=2", "m=Male f=Female"). Comma between codes is optional.}

\item{ageunit}{Character string specifying age units when xvar represents age.
Options: "day", "week", "month", "year" (default). Not used for weight-for-length/height charts.
Conversions: 1 year = 12 months = 365.25/7 weeks = 365.25 days}

\item{gestage}{Numeric vector of gestational ages in weeks (optional). Enables age adjustment
for gestational age. Default assumption is 40 weeks. Ages are corrected by (gestage-40) weeks.
Warning given if any gestational age > 42 weeks. Only valid for age-based charts.}

\item{nocutoff}{Logical. If FALSE (default), z-scores with absolute values ≥5 are set to NA
to flag potential data entry errors. If TRUE, all z-scores are returned regardless of magnitude.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of z-scores with the same length as the input measure vector.
NA values indicate: age out of range, missing gender, gestational age placing corrected
age out of range, non-positive measurements, or |z-score| ≥ 5 (unless nocutoff=TRUE).
}
\description{
This function calculates z-scores for anthropometric measurements using the LMS method
and reference data from various growth charts: 2000 CDC Growth Reference, British 1990
Growth Reference, WHO Child Growth Standards, WHO Reference 2007, UK-WHO Preterm Growth
Reference, and UK-WHO Term Growth Reference.
